## A Game Application Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming

**What does this project do?**

I wanted to build a fun game app and learn object oriented programming. With this in mind, I came up with a 'hang-man' type game, where you can guess a commonly used phrase. The player can interact with the onscreen keyboard as well as the physical keyboard to guess each letter in the phrase. The game ends when either the player guesses the complete phrase or loses all 5 heart lives. In both events, the 'Start Game' button resets and starts a new game.

**What are the key features of this project?**

- Object-oriented programming using JavaScript
- Keeps track of the player's lives and will reset with game is over
- Different phrases are generated randomly and dynamically appear according to the number of letters in the phrase.
