## A Prototype Travel Checklist App

**What does this project do?**

It is a responsive web application that dynamically creates a travel checklist for individual as well as group travelers. Currently it is in its MVP stage, but will continue to be updated regularly with new features. Future updates include weather forecast information based on dates of travel, tabs to keep track of each traveler in the check list, etc. This project was also created to demonstrate my skills in using popular modern frontend tools **Bootstrap** and **React**.

**What are the key features of this project?**

- Input form home page
- Dynamic rendering of a checklist with customizable options
