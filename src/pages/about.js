          <p>Hello! I take it you are interested in getting to know me and my work a little better.</p>
          <p>I came out of a coding bootcamp in 2021, where I learned how to be a fullstack web developer.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to April 2022, I landed my first job building new features for a logistics company's internal software, but realized it wasn't for me.</p>
          <p>Months later, I decided to go the freelance route helping friends and family build websites and web applications for various small business needs.</p>
          <p>On top of looking after my two rambunctious kids, on the slight chance of having free time, I like to think about problems in my life and how to solve them using code.</p>
          <p>If you like what you see, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
